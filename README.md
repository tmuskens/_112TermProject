# Swing Cricket by Trent Muskens
andrewid: tmuskens
Swing Cricket is a cricket game where you want to hit the ball into different zones to score as many runs as possible.
If a ball hits your stumps or you hit it into a yellow zone, you're out.
If the game is running too slowly, toggle to fast graphics on the home page.
